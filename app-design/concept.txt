1. Splash Screen: Imagine a serene দৃশ্য with softly animated butterflies fluttering across the screen and delicate flowers swaying gently. The app's title, "Ammu's Diary," appears with an elegant animation, perhaps a subtle fade-in or a graceful unfolding effect. The background is a calming gradient, possibly transitioning between light pastel shades of blue, green, or lavender, creating a tranquil and inviting atmosphere. 2. Home: The Home screen welcomes the user with a warm and friendly greeting, such as "Welcome to Ammu's Diary," displayed in a prominent, stylish font. Below the greeting, there's a brief, encouraging message like "Start your day with reflection and inspiration." The "Get Started" button is centrally located and visually appealing, with rounded corners and a color that complements the app's overall palette, perhaps a soft teal or a gentle rose. The background could feature a subtle, textured pattern or a single, calming image, like a blurred nature photograph. 3. Notes: The Notes screen has a clean and organized layout. At the top, there's a header with the title "My Notes" and possibly a subtle icon related to journaling or writing. Below the header, you'll see a list of journal entries, each represented by a card-like element. Each card displays a preview of the note's content (perhaps the first few lines), the date and time it was created, and a small mood indicator (an icon or a colored dot representing the mood associated with the note). Options to filter the notes by mood are available, possibly as a row of selectable mood icons or a dropdown menu. The floating action button (FAB) for adding a new note is positioned at the bottom right, using a consistent color and an intuitive icon (like a "+" or a quill). 4. Note Detail: This screen provides an immersive reading experience. The full content of the selected note is displayed in a clear, readable font. The mood associated with the note is visually represented, perhaps with a larger mood icon or a colored banner at the top. If a background image was chosen for the note, it's displayed subtly behind the text, creating a visually rich and personalized backdrop. At the top right, there are options to edit (pencil icon) or delete (trash can icon) the note, presented discreetly so they don't distract from the content. 5. Note New/Edit: The Note New/Edit screen is designed for easy input. A large text area dominates the screen, allowing users to comfortably write their journal entry. Above the text area, there's a field or a placeholder that prompts the user for a title or a brief summary of the note. Below the text area, there are controls for selecting the mood, possibly a row of mood icons or a dropdown menu with descriptive mood labels. An option to add or change the background image is available, perhaps as a button that opens an image picker or a gallery of pre-selected images. The screen has clear "Save" and "Cancel" buttons, using recognizable icons and colors to indicate their functions. 6. Explore: The Explore screen is visually engaging, presenting inspirational quotes in an appealing layout. A search bar at the top allows users to quickly find quotes by keywords or themes. Below the search bar, quotes are displayed in individual cards or styled containers, each featuring the quote text and the author's name. Quotes can be categorized (e.g., "Love," "Motivation," "Nature"), with category filters presented as tabs or a scrollable list. The background could feature subtle imagery related to inspiration, such as a blurred image of a sunrise or a pattern of abstract shapes. 7. Calendar: The Calendar screen offers a familiar calendar grid layout. Each day is clearly marked, and days with journal entries are visually distinguished, perhaps with a colored dot or a subtle background highlight. Tapping on a day with an entry could open a preview of the note or directly navigate to the Note Detail screen. A legend or key explains the meaning of any visual indicators used (e.g., colors representing different moods). Navigation controls (arrows or month/year selectors) allow users to easily browse different months and years. 8. Settings: The Settings screen presents a list of customizable options in a clean and organized manner. Each setting is represented by a clear label and a control element, such as a toggle switch for enabling/disabling dark mode, a dropdown menu for selecting a theme or font, or a button that leads to further customization options. Icons can be used to visually represent each setting, making the screen more intuitive. The overall layout is spacious and easy to navigate, with clear visual hierarchy.
